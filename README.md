People around you keep arguing over which OS is the best? None of the top Operating systems suits your needs?  You hate Computers? <br>
**NaOS** (**N**ot **a**n **O**perating **S**ystem) gets rid of all the trouble conventional OSes give you. No more  Software incompatibilities, long boot times or people complaining about you not using Arch.<br>
Statistics show that 95% of people using NaOS are more successful in life than any users of any other OS (*seriously, fuck the other 5%*).<br>
Not only is NaOS faster, we've removed as much bloat as possible to save Space. No more Cortana/Siri telling you unfunny jokes and no preinstalled Candy Crush. In fact, we even went so far as to remove all the useful stuff. This means NaOS fits on a Floppy and runs as smooth as butter, even on a literal potato.<br>
